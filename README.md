# GBI_timestamps

A repository of input timestamp files to be used with GBI for console verification of TASes.

Unless marked otherwise, all game versions are USA 1.0

Some runs requite SRAM written to the cart in order to work, such runs will have the necessary SRAM file present as a .sav file.

The ROM set_ram_to_0.gbc will set all WRAM and HRAM to 0. It will then turn the screen off, and execute an infinite loop from VRAM.

Games requiring RAM clear:

Oracle of Seasons
Oracle of Ages
Daiku no Gen-san - Ghost Building Company (Gensan 1)
